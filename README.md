# JavaScript_Practice
This is just a place to store some of my Javascript Projects that I can't tie into my website.

Game-
This folder is some practice work from the textbook "Eloquent Javascript 3rd edition". It is a platformer where the textbook gave the engine, the levels, and the base CSS. I added in a new enemy character, "monster" which acts like a horizontal lava block except it is taller, purple and can be erased by jumping on it. I put the monster in the first level. I also added in a lives system, a pause option, visual representations of those two on the site instead of being in the console (not perfect since it is an input), and the ability to sprint.
